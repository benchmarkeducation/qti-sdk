A simple testing file was created to help in verifying the conversions are working fine.

# Installation

To run this locally php 8 or higher must be installed and composer setup.

Run componser install to install the require libraries the library uses

# Usage

The sample.php file is what will be ran. One line 19 in the file the absolute path to a QTI xml file will need to be placed. TO run the script do

`php sample.php`

Running this should provide errors to help guide you to what needs to modified to make the file work.

For your conveniece I have add an item.xml file in the root folder that is a QTI 3.0 version of an assessment item. The contents of this file can be changed to test whatever needs to be test.
